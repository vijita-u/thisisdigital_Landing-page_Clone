## Features
- GSAP Animations using GSAP timelines for the hero section.
- Scroll Trigger animations and a Swiper JS Carousel, thoughtfully designed to closely mirror the original.
- A fully responsive design, prioritizing accessibility and usability across various devices.

## Additional Features from my end

The website clone comprises three essential sections: the hero section, a secondary page, and a carousel page. These were meticulously crafted to serve as my hands-on learning grounds for mastering the trio of technologies I set out to explore: GSAP timelines, ScrollTrigger, and SwiperJS. While the tutorial offered valuable insights, I went the extra mile to ensure the website's full responsiveness. I replicated key elements like the burger menu, hero section, and carousel for the mobile view, prioritizing an enhanced mobile user experience. This aspect, which was not addressed in the tutorial, played a pivotal role in advancing my expertise in responsive design.
